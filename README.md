# Introduction

## Hi, I'm Amanda :)

I'm a Navy veteran who served for 8 years as a Musician.  I have a degree in Clarinet Performance from the University of Cincinnati, College-Conservatory of Music.  I'm taking FEWD 2 in hopes to become a web designer.

Some of my hobbies are:

* Gardening
* Painting
* Making clay miniatures

Here's a picture of me standing outside the Cat Cafe in SD:
